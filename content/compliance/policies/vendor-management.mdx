## Purpose
We manage vendor risk by selecting reputable providers and reviewing them periodically.

## Scope
This policy applies to vendors that store, process, or transmit PixieDVC data.

## Responsibilities
- Leadership approves vendor selection and renewal.
- Engineering maintains vendor configurations and data access controls.

## Policy statements
- Vendors are reviewed before onboarding and periodically thereafter.
- Where available, we review vendor compliance documentation (SOC 2, ISO).
- The vendor list is maintained in the compliance baseline inventory.
- Vendors are removed or replaced if they no longer meet requirements.

## Review cadence
This policy is reviewed at least annually and whenever a material change occurs.
