## Deposits

- Deposits stay fully refundable until PixieDVC confirms a match with a verified owner.
- If we cannot match your request before the service-level deadline, the deposit auto-refunds within 24 hours.

## After Confirmation

- If you need to cancel after a confirmation number is issued, PixieDVC will help negotiate alternative dates or partial refunds.
- Weather-related exceptions follow Disney Vacation Club policies; documentation may be required.

Still unsure? Email **hello@pixiedvc.com** with your booking ID and we will walk you through options.
