# What Is Disney Vacation Club and How Does It Work

## Introduction
Disney Vacation Club, often called DVC, can feel confusing at first glance. Many guests hear about points, ownership, and rentals without understanding how it all fits together.

This guide explains the basics in clear language so you can understand what DVC is and how it works.

## What Disney Vacation Club Is
Disney Vacation Club is a vacation ownership program created by Disney.

Members purchase an ownership interest that gives them a set number of points each year. These points are used to book stays at Disney Vacation Club resorts.

## How the Points System Works
Points are the currency of DVC.

The number of points needed depends on:

1. Resort location
2. Room type
3. Time of year
4. Day of the week

Higher demand nights require more points.

## Why Disney Created DVC
DVC was designed to reward repeat Disney travelers.

Instead of paying cash each visit, members pre pay for future vacations and use points to book stays over many years.

## How Renting Fits In
Some members do not use all their points every year.

Renting allows those unused points to be used by guests who want to stay at DVC resorts without owning a membership.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is DVC a timeshare
It is a form of vacation ownership, but it works differently from traditional timeshares.

### Do guests need to understand points to rent
No. Platforms and owners handle point calculations, but understanding the basics helps.

## Next Step
With the basics understood, learning how renting DVC points works will make the process feel much more approachable.
