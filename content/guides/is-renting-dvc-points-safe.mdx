Renting DVC points is a common way to stay at Disney Deluxe resorts. The key is using a trusted process with verified owners and clear communication.

## What makes a rental legitimate
- The booking is created inside the official Disney Vacation Club system.
- You receive a Disney confirmation number once the reservation is secured.
- The owner controls the points, but the stay is real and recognized by Disney.

## How PixieDVC helps
We verify owners, document the process, and provide a concierge team that monitors timing and availability. That keeps your request organized and transparent from start to finish.

## A simple checklist
- Confirm you receive a Disney confirmation number.
- Ensure your details match your Disney account for linking.
- Keep a clear record of your request and confirmation.
