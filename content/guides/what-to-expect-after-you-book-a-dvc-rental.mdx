# What to Expect After You Book a DVC Rental

## Introduction
Once your DVC rental is confirmed, most guests feel two things at once, excitement and a desire to make sure everything is truly set. That is completely normal. The good news is that a confirmed DVC reservation behaves much like any other Disney resort reservation.

This guide explains what happens after booking, what you can do next, and what is worth double checking so you can move forward with confidence.

## Your Disney Confirmation and What It Means
After the reservation is made, you should receive a Disney confirmation number. This confirmation indicates the stay exists in Disney's system.

If you are working with a concierge led platform, you can also expect clear guidance on what comes next, along with support if you have questions.

## Linking Your Reservation
Most guests link their reservation in My Disney Experience. Once linked, you can see your resort stay, manage travel details, and coordinate plans in one place.

If you have trouble linking, it is usually a small mismatch in details, such as name formatting. Support can help resolve this quickly.

## Planning Your Trip Like a Resort Guest
With a confirmed resort reservation, you can plan the same way most Disney resort guests plan.

Common next steps include:

1. Confirm park tickets
2. Plan dining reservations
3. Review transportation options
4. Coordinate arrival day details

Your stay should feel like a normal Deluxe resort experience.

## Housekeeping and Stay Logistics
One difference with many DVC stays is housekeeping frequency. Rather than daily service, housekeeping is often provided on a limited schedule.

This is expected and is part of the DVC experience, not a problem with your reservation.

## What Not to Worry About
Many first time renters worry about the reservation disappearing. Once it is confirmed in Disney's system, the stay is real.

It is still wise to keep your confirmation information saved, but you do not need to treat the reservation as fragile.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I call Disney to confirm the reservation
You can, and many guests do for peace of mind. If the reservation is in your name, Disney can confirm basic details.

### Can I add tickets and dining plans
You can add tickets through your Disney account. Dining plans and promotions vary, and they are not automatically included with a DVC rental.

### Who do I contact if I need help
If you booked through a concierge led platform, support is typically available to guide you. If you booked informally, communication is usually through the owner.

## Next Step
If you are comparing options and deciding whether to rent points or book another way, the next guides will help you evaluate alternatives with clarity.
