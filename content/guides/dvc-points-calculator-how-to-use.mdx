Estimating your stay before booking
A DVC points calculator helps you understand what a stay may cost — in both points and dollars — before availability is confirmed. It’s a planning tool designed to set expectations, compare options, and guide smarter decisions.

<KeyTakeaways
  items={[
    "A calculator turns point charts into a clear estimate before you request availability.",
    "Small changes in dates, nights, and views can shift totals more than most guests expect.",
    "Use estimates to compare options, not to assume a room is available.",

## The inputs that matter most
A calculator estimate is only as good as the inputs you choose. These have the biggest impact:
- Check-in date
Point costs vary by season. Even shifting dates by a day or two can change the total meaningfully.
- Number of nights
Points are charged per night. Longer stays multiply the total, but often improve overall value compared to cash rates.
- Room type and view
Studios typically require the fewest points. Larger rooms and premium views increase point cost but add space and amenities.
- Resort selection
Different resorts can require very different point totals for similar locations or experiences.

## Tips for better estimates
- Try nearby date ranges to see how seasonal changes affect pricing
- Compare two resorts in the same area rather than focusing on a single option
- Use the estimate to decide where flexibility matters most (dates, view, or room type)
- Treat the result as a range, not a guarantee, until availability is confirmed

<Callout variant="quick" label="Quick Takeaway">
  Estimates are most useful when they help you compare options, not when they promise a specific room.

## Common misconceptions
“The calculator shows live availability”
It doesn’t. It estimates cost based on published point charts, not real-time inventory.
“The estimate is the final price”
Actual availability, owner pricing, and demand can affect final terms.
“If it prices out, it must be available”
High-demand rooms and dates may still be unavailable even if the estimate looks reasonable.
Understanding these limits helps avoid frustration later.

  The most popular studios and peak dates can disappear quickly, even when the estimate looks reasonable.
