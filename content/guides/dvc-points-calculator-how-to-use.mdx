A points calculator helps you estimate how many points (and dollars) a stay may cost based on dates, room type, and resort.

## The inputs that matter most
- **Check-in date**: Points change by season, so dates drive the total.
- **Nights**: Longer stays multiply the point total.
- **Room type and view**: Studios are typically the lowest point cost, while premium views cost more.

## Tips for better estimates
- Try a few nearby date ranges to see how the price shifts.
- Compare two resorts with similar proximity to parks.
- Use the estimate to decide whether to stay flexible on room type.
