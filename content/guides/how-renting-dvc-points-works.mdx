Renting DVC points is a simple way to stay at deluxe Disney resorts without owning points yourself. The process is different from booking on Disney.com, but it is straightforward when you know the steps.

## Step 1: Choose your stay
Pick your dates, resort preferences, room type, and any flexibility. This helps determine the point estimate.

## Step 2: Submit a request
A request deposit holds your place in the queue while a concierge works to match you with a verified owner.

## Step 3: Match and confirm
Once an owner can book your stay, the reservation is secured through the official DVC system. You receive a Disney confirmation number.

## Step 4: Link and plan
After confirmation, you can link the reservation in Disney apps to manage dining, check-in, and trip planning.

## How PixieDVC helps
You can rent points directly from owners, but PixieDVC keeps the process safe and structured. We verify owners, monitor booking windows, and deliver a confirmed reservation number you can rely on.
