# How to Link Your DVC Rental to My Disney Experience

## Introduction
After booking a DVC rental, linking the reservation to My Disney Experience is an important step. Doing so allows guests to manage their stay, plan park visits, and coordinate dining and transportation.

This guide explains how to link a reservation and what to do if something does not work right away.

## What You Need Before Linking
Before starting, guests should have the Disney confirmation number and the reservation name exactly as it appears.

Matching details helps prevent errors during the process.

## Step One, Log In to My Disney Experience
Guests should log in to their My Disney Experience account through the website or app.

Once logged in, navigate to the section for linking reservations.

## Step Two, Enter Reservation Details
Guests enter the confirmation number and last name associated with the reservation.

If the details match Disney records, the stay will appear in the account.

## Step Three, Confirm the Link
After the reservation appears, guests should review the stay details to ensure accuracy.

At this point, planning tools become available.

## What to Do If Linking Fails
Linking issues are usually minor.

Common fixes include:

1. Double checking name spelling
2. Waiting a short period after booking
3. Contacting the platform or Disney for assistance

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I link the reservation immediately
In most cases, yes, but sometimes there is a short delay after booking.

### Does linking change the reservation
