Avoiding a few common mistakes can make your DVC rental smoother and more flexible.

## Mistake 1: Waiting too long
Popular resorts and views can book early. Start your plan as soon as your dates are known.

## Mistake 2: Overly tight dates
Giving a little flexibility can unlock better options without changing your trip vibe.

## Mistake 3: Ignoring point seasons
Point totals shift by season. Use the calculator to compare different weeks.

## Mistake 4: Skipping alternates
Backup resorts or views can keep your request moving when inventory is tight.

## How PixieDVC helps
We guide your request, work with verified owners, and keep your reservation process organized so small mistakes do not derail the booking.
