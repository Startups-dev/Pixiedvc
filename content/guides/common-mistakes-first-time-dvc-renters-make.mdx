# Common Mistakes First Time DVC Renters Make

## Introduction
Renting DVC points for the first time can feel unfamiliar. Most issues guests encounter are not serious, but they often stem from misunderstandings rather than real problems.

This guide explains common mistakes and how to avoid them.

## Waiting Too Long to Plan
One of the most common mistakes is waiting too long to submit a rental request.

Popular resorts and room types fill early, especially during high demand seasons.

## Assuming Hotel Like Flexibility
DVC rentals do not follow hotel cancellation rules.

Guests who assume changes will be easy often feel surprised later.

## Not Understanding Room Types
Some guests choose room types without considering space or layout.

Studios, one bedroom villas, and larger villas serve different needs.

## Ignoring Agreement Details
Rental agreements explain important rules.

Guests who do not review them carefully may misunderstand cancellation terms or responsibilities.

## Overlooking Travel Insurance
Travel insurance is often skipped.

For guests concerned about unexpected changes, insurance can provide added peace of mind.
