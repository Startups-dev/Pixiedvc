## The short version
Disney Vacation Club (DVC) is Disney’s vacation ownership program. Instead of paying a nightly hotel rate, members use points to reserve deluxe resort accommodations.
When members can’t use their points, they may rent them out. This allows non-members to book villas that often include kitchens, extra space, and premium resort perks — usually at a lower cost than standard cash rates.
PixieDVC acts as the professional layer between guests and owners, ensuring the process is clear, secure, and well-managed from request to confirmation.

## What Disney Vacation Club is
DVC is a points-based vacation ownership system. Members purchase a set number of points and use them each year to book stays at participating deluxe Disney resorts.
Each resort has a points chart that determines how many points are required based on:
- Travel dates
- Room type
- View category
Points function like a currency, not a discount. A stay simply “costs” a certain number of points, regardless of the cash price Disney may be charging at the time.

## Why DVC rentals are popular
DVC villas are designed for longer, more comfortable stays. Many include:
- Separate sleeping areas
- Full or partial kitchens
- In-room laundry (in larger villas)
- Access to deluxe resort amenities
For families or groups staying four nights or longer, renting points often provides more space and flexibility than a standard hotel room. The value becomes especially noticeable when booking studios or multi-room villas.

## How point charts work (at a high level)
Each DVC resort publishes a points chart that assigns a point cost to every room type, view, and date.
Peak seasons and premium views require more points. Slower seasons and standard views require fewer. The chart stays consistent year to year, even if Disney’s cash prices fluctuate.
When renting points, the total cost is calculated by multiplying the required points by a price-per-point agreed upon with the owner or platform.

## Where PixieDVC fits
Renting points directly from an owner is possible, but it involves coordination, trust, and timing.
PixieDVC sits between guests and owners to:
- Estimate point requirements
- Match requests with verified owners
- Coordinate booking details
- Ensure a proper Disney confirmation number is issued
Once secured, the reservation appears like any other Disney booking — it’s real, confirmed, and managed through Disney’s systems.

## How PixieDVC helps
PixieDVC manages the operational side of DVC rentals so guests don’t have to.
That includes:
- Verifying owners before any booking
- Organizing agreements and timelines
- Tracking reservation details
- Communicating clearly at each step
The goal is to make renting points feel structured and professional, not informal or uncertain.

## Who this is for — and who it’s not
<DecisionTile
  goodFit={[
    "You are staying four nights or longer.",
    "You value space, kitchens, and deluxe resorts.",
    "You are comfortable planning ahead.",
    "You want help navigating availability and options.",

  betterIf={[
    "You are planning a last-minute trip.",
    "You are staying only one or two nights.",
    "You prefer daily housekeeping.",
    "You need maximum flexibility to change plans.",

Being clear about fit helps avoid surprises later.

## Common misconceptions
“DVC rentals are timeshares”
DVC is a timeshare product, but renting points does not involve ownership, presentations, or long-term commitments. Guests are simply booking a stay using someone else’s points.
“You don’t get a real Disney reservation”
You do. Once booked, the stay has a valid Disney confirmation number and appears in Disney’s system like any other reservation.
“Renting points is risky”
It can be without safeguards. That’s why verification, clear communication, and structured handling matter. Using a platform designed for this reduces uncertainty significantly.
