DVC (Disney Vacation Club) is Disney's vacation ownership program. Instead of booking a standard hotel rate, members use points to reserve Deluxe Disney Resort accommodations.

## The short version
- Members buy points and use them like a currency for stays.
- Each resort has its own points chart based on dates, room type, and view.
- Renting points lets non-members stay in DVC villas without buying a membership.

## Why rentals are popular
DVC villas often include kitchens, extra space, and deluxe resort perks. Renting points can lower the cost compared to standard cash rates, especially for longer stays.

## Where PixieDVC fits
We help guests estimate point costs, submit a request, and match with verified owners who can book the stay. You get a real Disney confirmation number once secured.

## How PixieDVC helps
You can rent points from a DVC owner, but PixieDVC manages the steps for you. We verify owners, handle the booking workflow, and keep your reservation organized and secure.
