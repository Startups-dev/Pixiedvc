DVC villas often include kitchenettes or full kitchens, which makes groceries a smart way to save money and time.

## Quick planning tips
- Pack breakfast staples to save early mornings.
- Keep snacks handy for pool days.
- Use grocery delivery services that support Disney resort drop-off.

## In-villa convenience
A few simple supplies can make your stay more comfortable, especially for families or longer trips.
