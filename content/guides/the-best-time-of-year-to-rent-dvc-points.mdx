# The Best Time of Year to Rent DVC Points

## Introduction
One of the most effective ways to improve both availability and value when renting DVC points is choosing the right time of year. Demand for Disney resorts changes throughout the calendar.

This guide explains how seasonal patterns affect DVC rentals and how guests can plan smarter.

## High Demand Seasons
Certain times of year consistently see higher demand.

These periods often include:

1. Major holidays
2. School breaks
3. Popular seasonal events

During these windows, availability is limited and advance planning is essential.

## Moderate Demand Seasons
Some seasons balance good availability with enjoyable conditions.

Guests often find moderate demand during:

1. Early fall outside holidays
2. Late winter between peak breaks
3. Select spring weeks

These periods can offer strong value without heavy crowds.

## Lower Demand Seasons
Lower demand seasons typically provide the most flexibility.

These may include:

1. Early January after holidays
2. Late summer weeks
3. Select September travel dates

Availability is often wider and booking is less stressful.

## Weather and Crowd Considerations
Lower demand does not always mean ideal weather.

Guests should balance availability, comfort, and crowd levels when choosing dates.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does lower demand always mean cheaper rentals
Not always, but it often improves availability and choice.

### Is it worth avoiding peak seasons
For many guests, yes. Others prefer peak periods despite higher demand.

## Next Step
With timing in mind, choosing the right room type can further improve comfort and value.
