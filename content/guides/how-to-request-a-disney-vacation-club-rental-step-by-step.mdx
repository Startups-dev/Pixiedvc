# How to Request a Disney Vacation Club Rental Step by Step

## Introduction
Requesting a Disney Vacation Club rental can feel unfamiliar the first time, especially compared to booking a hotel directly. The process is straightforward once you know what to expect.

This guide walks through each step so you can submit a request with confidence.

## Step One, Choose Travel Details
Before submitting a request, guests should confirm their travel dates, resort preferences, and room type.

Having flexibility with dates or resorts can improve success.

## Step Two, Submit the Request
Guests submit a rental request through a platform or directly with an owner.

The request typically includes:

1. Travel dates
2. Preferred resort
3. Room type
4. Guest names

This information allows the owner to check availability accurately.

## Step Three, Owner Confirms Availability
The owner reviews the request and confirms whether the points are available.

If available, the owner proceeds with booking the reservation in Disney's system.

## Step Four, Agreement and Payment
Once availability is confirmed, guests review and accept the rental agreement.

Payment is typically required before the reservation is finalized.

## Step Five, Reservation Confirmation
After booking, the reservation is placed in the guest's name and a Disney confirmation number is provided.

At this point, the stay exists in Disney's system.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does the request process take
Timing varies, but many requests are completed within a few days.

### What if my request cannot be fulfilled
Guests may adjust dates, resorts, or room types to improve availability.

## Next Step
With a confirmed reservation, guests can move on to planning tickets, dining, and travel details.
