# Do DVC Rentals Include Extra Magic Hours and Resort Perks

## Introduction
Guests often ask whether renting DVC points includes the same perks as booking directly through Disney. The answer is mostly yes, with a few important exceptions.

This guide explains which benefits apply to renters so expectations stay clear.

## Resort Guest Benefits
DVC renters are considered Disney resort guests.

This means renters usually receive:

1. Early park entry when offered
2. Access to Disney transportation
3. Use of resort amenities

These benefits are tied to the resort stay, not ownership.

## Member Only Benefits
Some perks are reserved specifically for DVC members.

Examples include:

1. Member lounges
2. Member exclusive events
3. Certain discounts

These benefits require membership credentials.

## Why the Difference Exists
DVC is a membership program, and some perks are designed to reward ownership.

This distinction does not affect the core resort experience for most guests.

## How Renters Should Plan
Renters should plan their trip assuming full resort access, but without relying on member only extras.

This approach avoids disappointment and keeps planning simple.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do renters get early entry
Yes, when early entry is offered to all resort guests.

### Are perks guaranteed
Perks can change based on Disney policies, but they apply equally to renters and hotel guests.

## Next Step
With perk expectations clear, guests can focus on enjoying their resort stay and park plans.
