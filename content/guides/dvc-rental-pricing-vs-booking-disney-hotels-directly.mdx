# DVC Rental Pricing vs Booking Disney Hotels Directly

## Introduction
Many guests compare renting DVC points with booking directly through Disney and wonder which option makes more sense. Both approaches have advantages. The key is understanding how they differ.

This guide compares the two options clearly so you can decide what fits your travel style.

## Booking Directly Through Disney
When booking directly with Disney, guests benefit from:

1. Flexible cancellation policies
2. Frequent promotions
3. Simplicity and speed

This option works well for travelers who prioritize flexibility over cost.

## Renting DVC Points
When renting DVC points, guests benefit from:

1. Lower nightly costs for Deluxe resorts
2. Larger rooms with kitchens
3. Access to premium resort locations

This option works best for planners who are confident in their dates.

## Cost Comparison
In many cases, a Deluxe studio booked through Disney can cost significantly more per night than the same room booked through DVC points.

Over a full stay, the difference can add up to thousands of dollars, especially for families.

## Flexibility Comparison
This is where the two options differ most.

Booking direct offers more flexibility. Renting DVC points offers better value.

Neither option is better in every situation.

## Who Each Option Is Best For
Booking directly is best for:

1. Short notice trips
2. Flexible travelers
3. Guests relying on promotions

Renting DVC points is best for:

1. Families planning ahead
2. Guests wanting Deluxe resorts
3. Value driven planners
