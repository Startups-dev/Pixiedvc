# How Far in Advance Should You Rent DVC Points

## Introduction
Planning ahead is one of the biggest advantages when renting DVC points. Knowing how far in advance to start helps improve availability and reduces last minute stress.

This guide explains typical planning windows and how they affect success.

## The Ideal Planning Window
For many guests, starting early offers the best results.

In general:

1. High demand resorts and seasons benefit from seven to eleven months of advance planning
2. Moderate demand travel can work well with four to six months of notice
3. Flexible or lower demand trips may succeed with shorter timelines

Earlier planning provides more options and flexibility.

## Why Demand Changes
Demand is influenced by school schedules, holidays, and seasonal events.

Understanding these patterns helps guests choose realistic timelines.

## Room Type Considerations
Larger rooms and popular layouts book faster.

Guests requesting studios may have more flexibility than those seeking multi bedroom villas.

## What Happens If You Plan Late
Late planning does not mean failure, but it does limit options.

Guests should expect fewer resort choices and less control over room type.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it ever too early to request a rental
No. Early requests help owners plan and improve success.

### Can flexible dates help
Yes. Flexibility is one of the best tools for late planners.

## Next Step
With timing expectations set, understanding how availability works across resorts can further improve planning success.
