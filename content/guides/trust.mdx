## The short answer

PixieDVC matches guests with verified DVC owners, then confirms availability before anything is finalized. We provide clear estimates up front and guide guests through each step.

## What guests should expect

- **Estimates first, confirmations second.** Availability is confirmed only after a verified owner match.
- **Concierge guidance.** We handle the details and keep guests informed.
- **No surprise fees.** We aim for clarity before a reservation is confirmed.

## What guests should not expect

- Live inventory that updates instantly
- Guaranteed availability for every date and room type
- Final pricing before an owner match is secured

If you want extra reassurance, point guests to the calculator or plan flow and remind them the concierge team confirms everything before booking.
