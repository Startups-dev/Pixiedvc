# Choosing the Right DVC Room for Larger or Multi Generational Families

## Introduction
Traveling with a larger group or multiple generations can be rewarding, but room choice plays a major role in comfort.

This guide explains how to choose a DVC room that supports shared time while preserving personal space.

## Why Room Layout Matters
Larger groups need space to relax without feeling crowded.

Separate sleeping areas, multiple bathrooms, and shared living spaces can significantly improve the experience.

## One Bedroom and Larger Villas
One bedroom villas provide a good balance of space and value.

Two bedroom and larger villas are designed specifically for extended families, offering multiple bedrooms and bathrooms.

## Privacy and Comfort Considerations
Multi generational trips often include different schedules and needs.

Choosing a layout that allows quiet time and shared time helps avoid tension during the stay.

## Kitchen and Laundry Benefits
Full kitchens and in unit laundry can make longer stays more comfortable, especially with children or seniors.

These features reduce daily logistics and add flexibility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do larger rooms cost significantly more
They require more points, but the cost per person can be reasonable when shared.

### Can large groups book multiple rooms instead
Yes, but staying together in one villa often improves convenience.

## Next Step
After choosing the right room size, understanding what to expect during the stay helps reduce stress.
