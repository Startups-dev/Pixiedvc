Check-in for a DVC rental works much like any Disney resort stay once your reservation is linked.

## Before you arrive
- Confirm your Disney confirmation number.
- Link the reservation in Disney apps when available.
- Make sure the lead guest name matches your account.

## On arrival
- Use mobile check-in if offered.
- Keep a photo ID ready for quick verification.
- Ask the front desk if any room updates are possible that day.

## After check-in
Review your stay details in the Disney app to confirm dates, guests, and room type.
