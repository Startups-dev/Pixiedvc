# How Disney Vacation Club Rentals Work Step by Step

## Introduction
Renting Disney Vacation Club points can feel unfamiliar at first. The process is simple once you understand the flow. This guide walks through each step clearly, from choosing dates to receiving your confirmation, so you know exactly what to expect.

## Step 1 Choosing Your Dates and Resort
The process begins with selecting your travel dates, preferred resort, and room type. Availability depends on point charts and booking windows, so flexibility helps, especially during busy seasons.

## Step 2 Submitting a Booking Request
Once your preferences are clear, a booking request is submitted. This request is matched with a DVC owner who has the right points available for your stay.

At this stage, nothing is booked yet. It is a matching process, not a commitment.

## Step 3 Owner Review and Acceptance
The owner reviews the request and confirms they can book the stay using their points. Once accepted, the reservation can be created directly through Disney in the guest's name.

## Step 4 Agreement and Payment
Before the reservation is finalized, a rental agreement is provided. This outlines responsibilities, cancellation terms, and payment structure. Payment is collected according to the agreement, often in one or two stages.

This step protects both the guest and the owner by setting clear expectations.

## Step 5 Reservation Confirmation
After booking, the guest receives a Disney confirmation number. At this point, the reservation can be linked inside My Disney Experience, just like any other Disney hotel stay.

From this moment on, the booking exists inside Disney's system.

## Step 6 Managing Your Stay
Guests can:

1. Link the reservation to My Disney Experience
2. Add park tickets
3. Make dining reservations
4. Plan Lightning Lane selections

The stay itself works the same way as any Disney resort booking.

## Step 7 After the Stay
Once the stay is completed, the rental process is complete. There are no further steps required for the guest.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I change dates after booking
Changes are very limited and depend on the owner and point availability.

### Is payment refundable
Most DVC rentals are non refundable once booked.

### Who do I contact during my stay
Support depends on the platform used. Concierge based platforms provide assistance throughout the process.
