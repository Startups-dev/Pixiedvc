# What DVC Renters Can and Cannot Do During Their Stay

## Introduction
Most DVC renters enjoy their stay without any issues, but understanding basic rules helps prevent confusion.

This guide explains what renters can expect, what is allowed, and what is restricted.

## What DVC Renters Can Do
Renters are treated as resort guests and can enjoy most hotel amenities.

This includes access to pools, transportation, dining, and early park entry when available.

## What DVC Renters Cannot Do
Some benefits are reserved for DVC members only.

These may include certain lounges, member events, or discounts.

## Why These Limits Exist
DVC is a membership program, and some perks are tied directly to ownership.

These limits do not affect the core resort experience for most guests.

## How to Avoid Confusion
Clear communication and realistic expectations are the best tools.

Guests should focus on the resort stay itself rather than member exclusive extras.

## Frequently Asked Questions

No. Resort staff treat renters the same as other guests.

### Can I add tickets and dining reservations
Yes. These are managed through your Disney account.

## Next Step
With expectations set, guests can relax and focus on enjoying their Disney vacation.
