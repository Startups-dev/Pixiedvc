# How Long the DVC Rental Process Takes

## Introduction
One of the most common questions guests ask is how long a DVC rental actually takes. Unlike instant hotel bookings, DVC rentals involve owners, points, and availability checks.

This guide explains the typical timeline so you know what to expect at each stage.

## The Request Stage
The process begins when a guest submits a rental request.

This stage can take a short amount of time depending on how quickly the request is reviewed and whether the dates and resort are available.

## Availability Review
Once a request is received, the owner checks point availability for the requested dates and room type.

This step may take additional time during busy travel seasons or when multiple options are being considered.

## Agreement and Payment
After availability is confirmed, the rental agreement is shared and payment terms are finalized.

Most rentals move forward only after the agreement is accepted and payment is completed.

## Reservation Creation
The owner then books the reservation using DVC points and places it in the guest's name.

Once booked, a Disney confirmation number is issued.

## Typical Timeframes
While every rental is different, many follow a general pattern.

1. Simple requests may complete within a few days
2. High demand dates may take longer
3. Flexible requests often move faster

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is the process ever instant
Sometimes, but most rentals require a short review period.

### Does planning earlier help
Yes. Early planning increases availability and reduces delays.

## Next Step
After receiving confirmation, guests can link their reservation and begin planning the details of their stay.
