# How Availability Works When Renting DVC Points

## Introduction
Availability is one of the most misunderstood parts of renting DVC points. Unlike hotels, availability depends on how and when owners can use their points.

This guide explains how availability works so expectations stay realistic.

## The Owner Booking Window
DVC owners have specific booking windows depending on whether they are booking their home resort or another DVC resort.

Home resort priority allows owners to book earlier for their own resort, which affects availability for renters.

## Why Popular Resorts Fill First
Resorts close to parks or with unique features tend to book quickly.

Room types with limited inventory also fill faster.

## How Flexibility Helps
Flexibility improves success.

Guests who are flexible with:

1. Travel dates
2. Resort choice
3. Room type

Often see better availability.

## What Platforms Can and Cannot Control
Platforms help coordinate requests and communication.

They cannot create availability where none exists.

## Managing Expectations
Understanding availability helps guests avoid frustration.

Early planning and flexibility are the most effective tools.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does availability change after booking
No. Once confirmed, the reservation is secure.

### Can availability open up later
Occasionally, but it should not be relied upon.

## Next Step
With availability understood, guests can submit stronger rental requests and plan with confidence.
