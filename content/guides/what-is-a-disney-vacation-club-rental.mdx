# What Is a Disney Vacation Club Rental

## Introduction
If you have ever looked at Disney Deluxe resort prices and wondered how some families stay there for much less, you are not alone. Renting Disney Vacation Club points is one of the most effective ways to enjoy Deluxe accommodations at a significantly lower cost. This guide explains what a Disney Vacation Club rental is, how it works in simple terms, and who it is best suited for.

## What Disney Vacation Club Actually Is
Disney Vacation Club, often called DVC, is Disney's vacation ownership program. Members purchase points instead of individual nights. These points can be used each year to stay at Disney Vacation Club resorts, which are mostly Deluxe category hotels located inside Walt Disney World and other Disney destinations.

Each resort has a points chart that determines how many points are needed per night, depending on room type, season, and day of the week.

## What Renting DVC Points Means
Renting DVC points means that a Disney Vacation Club member allows another guest to use their points for a stay, in exchange for payment. The guest stays at a Disney Deluxe resort, enjoys the same room and amenities, and is treated as a regular Disney resort guest during their stay.

The guest does not become a DVC member. They are simply using points that already belong to an owner.

## Why DVC Owners Rent Their Points
Not every owner uses all of their points every year. Life happens. Travel plans change. Rather than letting points expire, many owners choose to rent unused points to recover their annual dues and reduce overall ownership costs.

This creates an opportunity for guests to access Deluxe resorts at prices that are often far lower than booking directly through Disney.

## What Is Included in a DVC Rental
When you rent DVC points, you typically receive:

1. A confirmed reservation at a Disney Deluxe resort
2. Access to the same room types used by DVC members
3. Use of Disney transportation
4. Early theme park entry when available
5. Access to pools, dining, and resort amenities

Once the reservation is made in your name, it functions like a standard Disney hotel reservation.

## What Is Not Included
DVC rentals usually do not include:

1. Daily housekeeping, housekeeping is provided on a limited schedule
2. The ability to modify or cancel freely
3. Dining plans included by default
4. Ownership benefits reserved only for members

These differences are part of why the cost savings are possible.

## Who DVC Rentals Are Best For
DVC rentals are ideal for:

1. Families planning ahead
2. Guests comfortable with fixed travel dates
3. Travelers who want Deluxe resorts without Deluxe prices
4. International visitors who prefer larger rooms and kitchens

They are less suitable for travelers who need maximum flexibility or who book at the last minute.

## Frequently Asked Questions
