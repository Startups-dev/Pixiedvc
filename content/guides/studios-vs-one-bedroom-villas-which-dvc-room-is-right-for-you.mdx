# Studios vs One Bedroom Villas, Which DVC Room Is Right for You

## Introduction
Choosing the right room type is one of the most important decisions when renting DVC points. Studios and one bedroom villas serve different needs, even at the same resort.

This guide compares the two so guests can choose confidently.

## What a DVC Studio Offers
Studios are the most common DVC room type.

They typically include:

1. Sleeping space for up to four or five guests
2. A small kitchenette
3. One bathroom

Studios work well for shorter stays and smaller groups.

## What a One Bedroom Villa Offers
One bedroom villas provide significantly more space.

They usually include:

1. A separate bedroom
2. A full kitchen
3. A living area
4. In unit laundry

These features support longer stays and added comfort.

## Space and Privacy Differences
One bedroom villas offer more privacy and separation.

This can be especially helpful for families with different sleep schedules or multi day stays.

## Cost and Point Differences
One bedroom villas require more points per night.

However, for larger groups, the cost per person may be reasonable when compared to booking multiple rooms.

## How to Decide
The right choice depends on priorities.

Guests should consider:

1. Length of stay
2. Group size
3. Budget comfort
